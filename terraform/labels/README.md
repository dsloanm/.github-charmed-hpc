# `labels` Terraform plan

This is a Terraform plan for managing labels in Charmed HPC GitHub repositories using the
GitHub Terraform provider. For more information, refer to the
[documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs)
for the GitHub Terraform provider.

## Requirements

This plan requires that you have a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that grants
permissions to edit issue and pull request labels. Refer to the [usage](#usage) section for more details.

## Managed repositories

For the list of Charmed HPC repositories whose labels are managed by the `labels` Terraform plan, refer
to the `repository` variable in [_variables.tf_](./variables.tf). To add a new repository to the `labels`
plan, add the repository's name to this variable.

Note that the `labels` plan will fail with the 422 HTTP error code if the newly added repository already
has a label with the same name as a label defined in the plan.

## Usage

To add the labels to the repositories, first generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) with permission
to edit Issue/Pull Request labels. You can generate a PAT by navigating in GitHub to Settings > Developer
settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens and then select ___Generate new token___.

From the ___Generate new token___ page, provide a token name and then set the `canonical` GitHub organization
as the resource owner:

![Resource owner dropdown on Generate new token page with the `canonical` GitHub organization set as the owner](../../.github/images/resource-owner.png)

Then set access for each repository to be managed by the `labels` Terraform plan:

!["Only select repositories" radio button selected for repository access permission level with "hpc-team" as example repository](../../.github/images/repository-access.png)

Now set the repository permissions for _Issues_ to __Read and write__:

![Repository permissions for Issues with Access dropdown set to "Read and write"](../../.github/images/repository-permissions-issues-read-and-write.png)

With all the PAT options set, generate the token and copy it to your clipboard.

Now, run the `just apply` recipe with the following command, passing your
newly generated PAT as an environment variable:

```shell
CHARMED_HPC_ORG_PAT=<your PAT token> just apply labels
```

After a few minutes, Terraform should complete updating the all the given repository labels.
